# Predictive-maintenance-algorithm
With the advent of Industrial Revolution, more and more machines came into existence and
production multiplied many folds. With the increased use of machines need for proper
maintenance of these is also required. It is very necessary to have an idea of the life of every
part of machine to make production process go on smoothly.
The objectives of this project are:
1. Predict remaining useful life of engine
2. For a given value of number of cycles, predict whether the engine will fail or not

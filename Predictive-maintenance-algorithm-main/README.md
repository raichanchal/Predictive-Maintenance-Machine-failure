# Predictive-maintenance-algorithm
With the advent of Industrial Revolution, more and more machines came into existence and production multiplied many folds. With the increased use of machines need for proper
maintenance of these is also required. It is very necessary to have an idea of the life of every part of machine to make production process go on smoothly. Manual machine failure tracking is time consuming and erroneous. The objectives of this project are:
1. Predict remaining useful life of engine
2. For a given value of number of cycles, predict whether the engine will fail or not
Developed a pipeline, which detects if a machine system is close to failure using classification of continuous time series coming from sensors making use of LSTM. LSTM algorithm predicts RUL (remaining useful life) for the machine and test it whether it can qualify for further n steps.
